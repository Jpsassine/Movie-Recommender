# Movie-Recommender
This project allows a user to type in a movie they recently enjoyed and receive some top recommendations for similar movies based on a multitude of factors: actors, director, genres, score, year, etc. The data comes from IMDb and is parsed into a usable structure for the architecture using the Boost Tokenizer library. Although the program is currently only supporting movies, the creation included the foresight to use flexible architect that will allow many new forms of different media to be added with ease.
